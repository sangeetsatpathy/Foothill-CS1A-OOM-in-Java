    // the secret number?; if it isn't the secret number store it in the proper

    // made,
    // incorrect guesses, guesses remaining, secret number if all guesses used up,
    // error handling, etc.

    // the assignment instructions on applying the techniques of structured
    // (functional) decomposition)).

    // You may want to create a method to give a hint about the number guessed
    // (e.g., "My secret number is GREATER than " or "My secret number is LESS than
    // ")

    // You may want to create a method (e.g., playGame) that will check if the user
    // wants to play again, by calling the method for getting integer input from the
    // user,
    // (1 for 'yes', 0 for 'no') and incorporate the proper functionality depending
    // on the user's choice ( 1 or 0).

        // pertinent method (e.g., isGuessNum)

        // You might call and capture results from method (e.g., playGame) to see if
