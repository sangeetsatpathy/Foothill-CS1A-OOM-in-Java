             * Do whatever else you need to in order to: Step 1:figure out if the game
             * should be played again or that the entire program should quit and Step 2: set
             * the playing variable accordingly. You MUST have the gg.playGuessingGame()
             * method return something, so you will have a variable capture that return (for
             * example you could use the playing variable for that) and use that variable to
             * stop or continue the already written while loop. One example way: if
             * gg.playGuessingGame() == 0 then show a message and quit the game. Remember to
             * adhere to the "Program Guidelines" module item from the first week of the
             * course, such as NOT using the break or continue keywords.
